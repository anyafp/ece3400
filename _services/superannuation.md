## Objectives

* Understand low pass, high pass and bandpass filters using LTSpice
* Build a circuit with the microphone.
* Use MATLAB and Arduino to plot FFT graph of the signal picked up by the microphone.
* Amplify the sound outputted from the microphone.
* Implement low pass, high pass and bandpass filters to filter the amplified sound from the microphone.

## Introduction

Lab 3 was split into three parts. The first part was
