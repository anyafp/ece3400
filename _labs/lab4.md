## Objectives

* Code the Arduino to use the ultrasonic sensor.
* Get the robot to detect two objects using the ultrasonic sensor.
* Get the robot to navigate through obstacles.

## Introduction

In this final lab, we will combine everything (or most of it) we had done thus far, and additionally adding an ultrasonic sensor for ranging and obstacle sensing. By the end of the lab, we would have a robot that is able to navigate through an obstacle course.
